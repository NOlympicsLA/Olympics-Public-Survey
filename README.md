# Olympics-Public-Survey

## Introduction

Earlier this year, NOlympics LA conducted an online survey to gauge public opinion of the 2028 Summer Olympics across California and within LA County. This was primarily a response to the overwhelming lack of public input and dialogue around LA’s bid for the 2024 and 2028 Games, as well as the lack of independent polling conducted by local media and research institutions.

To date, only 3 polls and surveys have been conducted around the 2028 Olympics: one commissioned by the [bid committee](https://www.insidethegames.biz/media/file/75437/LMU%20Report%20-%20Olympics.pdf), one commissioned by the IOC and one [commissioned by us (NOlympics LA)](https://nolympicsla.com/2018/10/09/survey-results-and-analysis/). We do not consider any of them to be independent or adequate substitutes for meaningful dialogue with the communities who will be most affected and at risk.

## Results 

The results of our survey were markedly different than those commissioned by the bid committee and IOC, showing that almost half of respondents in California and L.A. County oppose hosting the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. You can read [our analysis](https://nolympicsla.com/2018/10/09/survey-results-and-analysis/) of the results ( [RMarkdown presentation](https://nolympicsla.github.io/code_survey3-slides.html#1)), and see some examples of open responses from people who took the survey [here](https://nolympicsla.com/2018/10/09/heres-what-real-californians-think-of-the-la-2028-olympics/).

In the spirit of continuing to provide as much information as possible to people who ask us questions, we wanted to share responses to some of the questions we got from supporters, journalists, and skeptics who saw the results of our survey, but weren’t sure how to interpret them. This is our [FAQ on surveys and data](https://nolympicsla.com/2018/11/29/la-2028-olympic-survey-faq/).

## Links to Data and Code

We believe in sharing our data, analyses, codebook and the survey itself to help demystify surveys, and how public opinion is measured and to aid data users in designing and getting experience analyzing survey data. The output from Survey Monkey - the vendor we used to supply random public responses is quite alike data output from Qualtrics and other survey vendors.

We hope that these are helpful for looking at the results of any survey or poll that you see reported in the media or referenced anywhere else.
